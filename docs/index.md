# WELCOME

Welcome to the Canonical Public Clouds Documentation. This site contains documentation related to Canonical offerings in the major clouds, as supported by the Canonical Public Cloud team. This includes information about supported Ubuntu versions and Canonical specific offerings.

This site is laid out following [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/). The cloud directories are placed at the highest level. Under clouds (AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, IBM, Canonical-Downloads) are products (EC2, EKS, GCE, GKE, etc.) and under products are the for documentations categories. Documentation is found at a corresponding level. Thus

* a reference describing AWS EKS is in AWS/EKS/reference
* a reference describing Canonical's general work on AWS is in AWS/reference
* a reference that describes something common to all clouds is in general/reference
* explanation of how to use the site is here, at the top level.
