Start: How to contribute

These docs are on located on a GitHub repository at: `ubuntu-cloud-docs`_ and you'll need a GitHub account to make contributions. It is a good idea to fork this repository into your own account before you start, otherwise GitHub will anyway prompt you to do so when you attempt your first change.

The docs are:

* structured using the `Diátaxis`_ approach,
* written in `reStructuredText`_ as per the `Canonical style guide`_,
* built with `Sphinx`_ and
* hosted on `Read the Docs`_.

We are always looking for ways to improve our docs, so we appreciate your contributions! 

Minor changes
-------------

If you've found a problem that can be fixed with a small change, you can use the *Edit this page on GitHub* link at the bottom of the relevant page to edit it directly on GitHub. When you are done with your edits, select :guilabel:`Commit changes...` on the top right. This will help you create a new branch and start a pull request (PR). Use :guilabel:`Propose changes` to submit the PR. We will review it and merge the changes.


Suggestions and questions
-------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Give feedback` button at the top of any page to create a GitHub issue for any suggestions or questions that you might have.


New content
-----------

While contributing new content, it is easier to work with the docs on your local machine. You can submit a PR after all the checks have passed and things looks satisfactory. You'll need ``make`` and ``python3`` installed on your system.

Download and install the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are working with these docs for the first time, you'll need to create a fork of the `ubuntu-cloud-docs`_ repository on your GitHub account and then clone that fork to your local machine. Once cloned, go into the ubuntu-cloud-docs directory and run:

.. code::

	make install

This creates a virtual environment and installs all the required dependencies. You only have to do this step once, and can skip it the next time you want to contribute.


Build and serve the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``make run`` command to build and serve the docs at ``http://127.0.0.1:8000`` or equivalently at ``http://localhost:8000``. This gives you a live preview of the changes that you make (and save), without the need for a rebuild:
