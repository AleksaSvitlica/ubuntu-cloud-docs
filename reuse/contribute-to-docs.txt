Start: How to contribute

These docs are on located on a GitHub repository at: `ubuntu-cloud-docs`_ and you'll need a GitHub account to make contributions. The docs are:

	* structured using the `Di√°taxis`_ approach,
	* written in `reStructuredText`_ as per the `Canonical style guide`_,
	* built with `Sphinx`_ and
	* hosted on `Read the Docs`_.

We are always looking for ways to improve our docs, so we appreciate your contributions! 

Minor changes
-------------

If you've found a problem that can be fixed with a small change, you can use the pencil icon at the top of the relevant page to edit it on GitHub. When you are done with your edits, select :guilabel:`Commit changes...` on the top right. This will help you create a new branch and start a pull request (PR). Use :guilabel:`Propose changes` to submit the PR. We will review it and merge the changes.


Suggestions and questions
-------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Give feedback` button at the top of any page to create a GitHub issue for any suggestions or questions that you might have.


New content
-----------

While contributing new content, it is easier to work with the docs on your local machine. You can submit a PR after all the checks have passed and things looks satisfactory.

Download and install the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are working with these docs for the first time, you'll need to fork and clone the `ubuntu-cloud-docs`_ repository to your local machine. Once cloned, go into the ubuntu-cloud-docs directory and run:

.. code::

	make install

This creates a virtual environment and installs all the dependencies specified in ``.sphinx/requirements.txt``. You only have to do this step once, and can skip it the next time you want to contribute.


Build and serve the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``make run`` command to build and serve the docs at `127.0.0.1:8000 <http://127.0.0.1:8000>`_ or equivalently at `localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_. This gives you a live preview of the changes that you make (and save), without the need for a rebuild:
