.. Introduction to clouds

**The images create a stable and secure cloud platform** that is ideal for scaling development work
done on Ubuntu-based systems. Since Ubuntu is one of the most favoured operating systems amongst
developers, using an Ubuntu-based image for the corresponding cloud deployment becomes the simplest
option.

**Everyone from individual developers to large enterprises use these images** for developing and deploying
their softwares. For highly regulated industries from the government, medical and finance sectors, 
various security-certified images are also available.

Start: Confidential computing

Data can be thought of as being in one of three states:  

* in-transit - being transmitted from one location to another
* at-rest - stored somewhere and
* in-use - being used by a CPU to perform some operation
  
Both data in-transit and data at-rest can be encrypted using well-known techniques, but for securing data in-use, you need confidential computing.

Confidential computing is the protection of data in-use by performing computation in a hardware-based trusted execution environment. It allows the encryption of data while it is in the system memory. This requires the support of both hardware and the OS. For example, your hardware could be based on AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualisation (SEV) architecture and the OS could be Ubuntu.
