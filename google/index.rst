Ubuntu on GCP
=============

**Ubuntu on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a set of customised Ubuntu images** that allow easy access 
to a wide range of products and services - offered by both Google Cloud and Canonical. These images 
have an optimised kernel that boots faster, has a smaller footprint and includes GCP-specific drivers.

**These images provide a foundation for deploying cloud-based software solutions,** specifically
for software built on Ubuntu and running on Google cloud. They focus on providing the optimal tools 
and features needed to run specific workloads.
