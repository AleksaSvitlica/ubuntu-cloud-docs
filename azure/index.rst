Ubuntu on Azure
======================================================

Canonical produces official Ubuntu images in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace 
and continuously tracks and delivers updates to these, ensuring security and 
stability are built-in from the moment your machines and containers launch.

Canonical works closely with Microsoft to optimise Ubuntu images on Azure and 
ensure Ubuntu supports the latest cloud features as these are released. Today, 
Ubuntu powers more mission-critical workloads on Azure than any other operating system.

Beyond Ubuntu Server images, Canonical offers a number of premium Ubuntu images 
that extend Ubuntu Server with additional security and management features, 
billed through your existing Microsoft Azure account.
