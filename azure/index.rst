Ubuntu on Azure
===============

**Ubuntu on Azure is a set of customised Ubuntu images** that allow easy access to a wide range 
of products and services - offered by both Microsoft Azure and Canonical.

**These images provide a foundation for deploying cloud-based software solutions,** specifically
for softwares built on Ubuntu and running on Azure. They focus on providing the optimal tools 
and features needed to run specific workloads.

**The images create a stable and secure cloud platform** that is ideal for scaling development work
done on Ubuntu-based systems. Since Ubuntu is one of the most favoured operating systems amongst
developers, using an Ubuntu-based image for the corresponding cloud deployment becomes the simplest
option.

**Everyone from individual developers to large enterprises use these images** for developing and deploying
their softwares. For highly regulated industries from the government, medical and finance sectors, 
various security-certified images are also available.
