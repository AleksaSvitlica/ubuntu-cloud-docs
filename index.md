# WELCOME

Welcome to the Canonical Public Clouds Documentation. This site contains documentation related to Canonical offerings in the major clouds, as supported by the Canonical Public Cloud team. This includes information about supported Ubuntu versions and Canonical specific offerings.

This site is laid out following [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/). The four main categories are placed at the highest level. Under each category are clouds (AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, IBM, Canonical-Downloads) and under each cloud are products (EC2, EKS, GCE, GKE, etc.). Documentation is found at a corresponding level. Thus

* a reference describing AWS EKS is in reference/AWS/EKS
* a reference describing Canonical's general work on AWS is in reference/AWS
* a reference that describes something common to all clouds is in reference/
* explanation of how to use the site is here, at the top level.
