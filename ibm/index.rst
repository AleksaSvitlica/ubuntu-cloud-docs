Ubuntu on IBM
=============


**Ubuntu on IBM is a set of customised Ubuntu images** that allow easy access to a wide range 
of products and services - offered by both IBM cloud and Canonical. These images have an optimised
kernel that boots faster, has a smaller footprint and includes IBM-specific drivers.

**These images provide a foundation for deploying cloud-based software solutions,** specifically
for software built on Ubuntu and running on IBM cloud. They focus on providing the optimal tools 
and features needed to run specific workloads.

---------

Canonical's offerings on IBM
----------------------------

Canonical and the Ubuntu community work together with IBM to ensure that Ubuntu works seamlessly across IBM platforms, including IBM Z and LinuxONE, IBM Power Systems and the IBM Cloud.

Canonical provides optimised Ubuntu LTS images with a custom kernel, minimal size, livepatch and support.

These images are available on IBM Cloud for both IBM VPC Infrastructure and IBM Classic Infrastructure.


---------

IBM VPC vs Classic Infrastructure
---------------------------------

IBM Cloud offers two types of infrastructure: IBM VPC Infrastructure and IBM Classic Infrastructure (Legacy).
For new users, IBM will only offer IBM VPC Infrastructure. Some long term users may still have access to the legacy IBM
Classic Infrastructure. 

IBM VPC offers numerous advantages over the legacy infrastructure, namely better performance, scalability, and ease of use.
